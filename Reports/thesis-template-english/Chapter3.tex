\chapter{Methods}\label{ch:methods}
With an understanding of the basics behind us, in this chapter we provide an overview of our contributions and proposed solution.

\section{Contributions}

\section{Experimental Designs} \label{experimental_design}
To test the conditions under which reductive evolution might occur, we conducted a series of experiments in which a ``wild type'' genome with 13,237 base pairs comprising 132 genes was cloned and each clone was allowed to evolve for 500,000 generations under a total of 7 different conditions. To control for experimental bias, we performed five runs of each condition, leading to a total of 35 experiments. 

\subsection{Inputs}
In Table \ref{table:parameters}, our parameter values for all input parameters may be found. Please note that for $\mu$, this represents the rates for point mutations, small insertions, and small deletions. The rearrangement rates were not changed under any condition and were always $1e-6$ for duplications, deletions, translocations, and inversions.
