\chapter{Results and Discussion}\label{ch:04results_discussion}
%TODO Remove chapter summary?

This chapter presents the results of the experiments as performed according to the plan described in Chapter~\ref{ch:03methods}. Section~\ref{results} provides the data and these results are discussed in Section~\ref{discussion}. 

\section{Results}\label{results}
In this section, the results of the experiments are presented. For each examined aspect, both a graphical representation of the data and some of the statistics are given, beginning with the conditions' impact on genome size. It should be noted that in many of the figures throughout this chapter, a rolling window of the mean was used to smooth the values, resulting in many of the plots only showing data starting after a few thousand generations (typically 10,000). It should be noted, however, that this is simply an artifact of the graphing process and organisms were continuously evolved for 500,000 generations. The values given in the tables and graphs are for the population at large unless specified as being for the best individual. 

\subsection{Genome Size}\label{sec:genome_size}

In this section the results of the different conditions are examined, focusing on which, if any, lead to a reduced genome. Figure~\ref{fig:genome_size} presents the main findings regarding genome size. In the figure, the blue line shows the control condition and the other colors show the changed conditions: $\mu_+$/$\mu_-$ (mutation up/down), $k_+$/$k_-$ (selection up/down), and $N_+$/$N_-$ (population up/down). As can be seen from the figure, the expectations from Section~\ref{sec:expected_results} did not always hold up, as several conditions actually \textit{increased} over their original size. 
\begin{figure}[H]

	\centering
	\caption[Genome size]{Average genome size across the population, in number of bases, of all conditions. Average taken across all five seeds for each condition.}
	\label{fig:genome_size}
\end{figure}
In fact, the $N_-$ condition had a runaway increase in the number of bases, reaching over 16,500 bases at one time, a 25\% increase over the original wild type's roughly 13,200 bp. Surprisingly, even after 500,000 generations it seems that the upper limit may still not have been reached. The statistical results are given below in Tables~\ref{table:genome_size_stats} and \ref{table:genome_size_mean_and_std_dev}, which show the mean and standard deviation among all five seeds over all generations.

\end{table} 

The next most obvious observation is that of the remaining conditions, all but the $k_+$ condition (which had an an increase of 11\% over the control condition) ended up with fewer base pairs than the control condition, though all increased slightly over their starting point. Also noteworthy is that the mutation down condition appears to have had a steady increase in the number of base pairs until a maximum of just over 14,000 around generation 350,000 before having a fairly sharp decline back to nearly the original size. 

Examining the percent changed from the \textit{control} condition shown in Figure~\ref{fig:genome_size_percent_change} it can be seen that at points, the $\mu_-$ condition was nearly 5\% smaller than the \textit{control} condition. 

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption[Genome size - percent change]{Genome size's percent change from the \textit{control} condition.}
	\label{fig:genome_size_percent_change}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Metabolic Error and Fitness}
Figure~\ref{fig:mean_fitness_plot} shows the mean fitness of the population for the control, mutation up/down, and population down conditions. Selection up/down were excluded from this graph because they were significantly outside of the range of the other conditions and made the results impossible to graph, but they are included in Figure~\ref{fig:global_fitness_histogram}, a histogram of the results.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{population_mean_fitness_chart}
	\caption[Mean fitness]{Plot of the mean fitness over time for the control, mutation up/down, and population down conditions.}
	\label{fig:mean_fitness_plot}
\end{figure}

The figure shows that the fitness of the control condition (in blue) consistently stayed at the same level, likely owing to the fact that the wild genotype had already been allowed to evolve for 10 million generations in this environment, so the phenotype closely lines up with the target before the simulations even began. Small fluctuations occurred due to mutations, insertions, etc. but since beginning with a clonal population of the best organism after 10 million generations in this same environment, the average fitness remained steady. 

More interesting is the population down condition, where the average fitness in the whole population sharply declined, sinking to 4.5\% below the control condition at generation 500,000. It seems that with the smaller population size, genetic drift may be more strongly at work in continually increasing the gap between the phenotype and environmental function, as the lack of variety inherent in a smaller population causes a cascade of increasingly deleterious consequences.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{global_fitness_histogram}
	\caption[Mean fitness histogram]{Histogram of population fitness at generation 500,000 for all conditions. Note that for the selection up condition, the scale is 1e-7.}
	\label{fig:global_fitness_histogram}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:global_fitness_histogram} shows a histogram of the population mean fitness values for all conditions. Although the $N_-$ condition ended the simulations in the most similar position to the \textit{control} condition, Figure~\ref{fig:global_fitness_histogram} makes it clear that the \textit{control} condition remained much steadier throughout the simulation, regularly jumping from value to value, whereas the \textit{mutation down} condition, as expected, tended to hover at certain locations in between rarer mutation events. 

Figure~\ref{fig:mean_metabolic_error} shows the mean metabolic error across all seeds for the whole population over time with respect to each condition. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{stat_fitness_global_mean_metabolic_error}
	\caption[Metabolic error]{Plot of the metabolic error over time for all conditions, average of all seeds}
	\label{fig:mean_metabolic_error}
\end{figure}

Table~\ref{table:fitness_means_std_dev} below gives the mean fitness scores for the population and the differing conditions. The selection down condition seems to be somewhat anomalous, as it was several orders of magnitude larger than all other conditions, despite having comparable genome sizes, numbers of genes, etc.

\subsection{Genome Structure}
In this section, the effects of the differing conditions on the structure of the genome as measured by the criteria in Tables~\ref{table:aevol_stats_genes_and_bp} and~\ref{table:aevol_stats_fitness_and_mutation} is examined. 

\subsubsection{Non-coding DNA}
One important factor in genome structure is the amount of non-coding DNA, i.e. the number of bases which are part of a genome but which do not encode protein sequences. Aevol gives the number of bases which are not in any coding sequence, as well as the total genome size, so one may easily calculate this percentage. The results from the experiments are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mean_non-coding_DNA}. Recalling genome size in Figure~\ref{fig:genome_size}, it seems that as the genome size of the population down condition rapidly expanded, most of those expansions were non-coding.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{percent_noncoding}
	\caption[Non-coding DNA]{Plot of the average (across all seeds) number of non-coding bases for the whole population over time for all conditions.}
	\label{fig:mean_non-coding_DNA}
\end{figure}
By comparison, despite the $k_+$ condition's rapid decline in fitness, it did not acquire more than 1\% non-coding DNA. 

The average percentages of non-coding DNA are given in Table~\ref{table:non-coding_DNA_mean_and_standard_deviation} below. 
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{4}{c}{\Large \textbf{\% Non-coding DNA}} \\
		\hline
		& \textbf{mean} & \textbf{standard deviation} & \textbf{mean's \% change from control} \\
		\hline \hline
		control & 38.622711 & 0.601258 & \textemdash \\ 
		\hline
		$\mu_+$ & 38.661764 & 0.707173 & 0.101114 \\ 
		\hline

		\hline
		$N_-$ & 45.462209 & 3.545778 & 17.708489 \\

	\end{tabular}
	\caption[Non-coding DNA mean and standard deviation]{Mean and standard deviation of non-coding percentages of DNA across all seeds.}
	\label{table:non-coding_DNA_mean_and_standard_deviation}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Number of Functional Genes}\label{sec:number_of_functional_genes}
Recall from Section~\ref{experimental_design} that a ``functional gene'' is a gene which produces a gene product. Specifically in Aevol, this means the production of a triangle of mean $m$, height $h$, and half-width $w$. Figure~\ref{fig:mean_num_functional_genes} below illustrates the mean number of functional genes across the population for each condition.  
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{stat_genes_global_mean_num_functional_genes}
	\caption[Mean number of functional genes]{Plot showing the mean number of functional genes for the population, averaged across all seeds for each condition.}
	\label{fig:mean_num_functional_genes}
\end{figure}
As seen in the figure, the \textit{selection up} condition showed the greatest increase in the number of functional genes in the whole population, reaching a maximum increase of about 2.2\% (131 to 134). This is in agreement with the predictions (from Table~\ref{table:experiment_predictions}) and the findings of Knibbe et al.~\cite{Knibbe2007}. Whereas most of the other curves are fairly flat, the mutation up condition fluctuates relatively rapidly, owing to the quick increase and decrease in the number of base pairs. 

The mean and standard deviation of the number of functional genes for the population for each condition is given in Table~\ref{table:number_of_genes_mean_std_dev} below.

\begin{table}[H]

\subsubsection{Number of Non-Functional Genes}
The average number of non-functional genes across all seeds for each condition is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:mean_num_non-functional_genes} below, and Table~\ref{table:non-functional_genes_mean_std_dev} provides the mean and standard deviation for all seeds and all conditions.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Average Size of Functional Genes}\label{sec:average_size_functional_genes}
Figure~\ref{fig:mean_functional_gene_size} shows the average number of base pairs for each functional gene for the population, mapped out over the 500,000 generations. The population down condition continues to be the outlier in terms of genome structure, with the average size of the functional genes remaining noticeably lower than for any other condition. It is worth pointing out, however, that the difference between the smallest average and the largest average is only 1 base pair. 
\begin{figure}[H]

Table~\ref{table:mean_functional_gene_size_and_std_dev} below gives the mean and standard deviation of the results, and Table~\ref{table:avg_size_of_functional_genes_rank_sum_and_p-value} gives the p-values for comparing the control condition to every other condition.

	\label{table:avg_size_of_functional_genes_rank_sum_and_p-value}
\end{table}
Since the $k_-$ condition's p-value was $\geq0.05$, it must be concluded that these results are not significant. 

\subsection{Evolvability}
In Figure~\ref{fig:evolvability_mean} below, the results of the experiments on evolvability for the best individual's (at generation 500,000) lineage are shown. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{evolvability_boxplot_all_seeds_avg}

	\label{fig:evolvability_mean}	
\end{figure}
The figure illustrates that, for each condition, overall the best individual still had quite low evolvability. For the selection up condition, however, the deviation from zero was even smaller, as illustrated in Table~\ref{table:mean_std_dev_evolvability} below, which provides the mean and standard deviation of the evolvability of the best individual in each condition. 

The evolvability rank sum and p-value information is given in Table~\ref{table:evolvability-rank_sum_and_p-values}.

\subsection{Robustness}
Recall from Section~\ref{subsec:robustness_antirobustness} that robustness is measured by the fraction of neutral offspring of an individual. In the following figure, a bar plot showing the spread of neutral offspring for the best individual is seen for the control condition as well as the six variations.

The mutation up condition clearly had the largest mean percentage of neutral mutants, at 0.5\%. The full statistics are given in the tables below:

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Analogously to Table~\ref{table:experiment_predictions}, the results of the experiments in Table~\ref{table:experiment_results_summary} are summarized below. For each cell, {\color{green} green} indicates that the prediction was confirmed in these experiments and {\color{red}red} indicates that the prediction must be rejected. The predictions for each condition are duplicated here for convenience, with a $+$ indicating a predicted increase and $-$ indicating a predicted decrease over the control condition.

\subsection{Genome Size}

According to the predictions based on a survey of the literature (summarized in Table~\ref{table:experiment_predictions}), only the $\mu_+$, $k_-$, and $N_+$ conditions were predicted to lead to a reduced genome. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:genome_size} however, although the $\mu_+$ and $k_-$ conditions did end up with a genome size which was noticeably smaller than the control condition. 

%TODO Fix this explanation once the N+ condition is done. Expectations were met but I actualyl wrote this as if they weren't. Oops!
One possible explanation is that, because the wild types had already been evolving for 10 million generations, and the environment was not varied further for these experiments, perhaps the wild types had reached a sort of stasis for which another half-million generations were not sufficient to fully demonstrate the effects of any changes. This may not explain everything, however, as some conditions (e.g. $\mu_+$, $N_-$) did see a rather rapid change in fitness, genome structure, etc. even in the (comparatively) short time. 

\subsection{Fitness}
Also of interest is that, along with the genome size, overall the fitness of the organisms did not change much with only one exception ($k_+$). It has been postulated that perhaps gene loss may be selected for in order to increase the overall fitness of an organism by removing the added cost of the superfluous genes~\cite{koskiniemi2012}. These results do not fully agree with this hypothesis, as the results show that, in addition to the general accumulation of non-coding DNA across all conditions (Figure~\ref{fig:mean_non-coding_DNA}), which would theoretically have a higher fitness cost, the number of genes actually \textit{increased} slightly for each condition, except for $k_-$. Likewise, fitness overall went \textit{up} as the number of genes increased (except for $N_-$). Lastly, decreasing the selection pressure resulted in the highest overall mean fitness by a wide margin (Table~\ref{table:fitness_means_std_dev}). In Aevol, non-coding DNA is not really associated with a fitness cost, so this explanation may likely also not fully apply. 

\subsection{Functional Genes}
Regarding the $N_-$ condition, comparing this with the results of Batut et al. and their work with \textit{Buchnera aphidicola} (see Section~\ref{related_work}), it may be possible that gene loss is occurring because of the smaller effective population size clicking down Muller's Ratchet. This does not seem to be what is happening in these experiments either, however. Though mean fitness of the $N_-$ condition did greatly decline (see Figure~\ref{fig:mean_fitness_plot}), the $N_-$ condition also saw the largest accumulation of non-coding DNA (see Figure~\ref{fig:mean_non-coding_DNA}) and the second-highest level of evolvability (see Table~\ref{table:mean_std_dev_evolvability}), which should theoretically have lead to an easier time of overcoming the ratchet. On the other hand, the number of functional genes stayed more or less the same as all of the other conditions, and the accumulated number of non-functional genes (pseudogenes) of the $N_-$ condition was the largest (see Figure~\ref{fig:mean_num_non-functional_genes}). These two factors together suggest that there almost certainly was some loss of fitness through pseudogenization; perhaps with more time, the pseudogenes would also have been lost.

Recall the work of Liard et al.\cite{Liard.2018} as discussed in Section~\ref{related_work}, in which the proposed ``complexity ratchet'' was overcome by increasing the mutation rate. Their work was quite successful in overcoming this ratchet, but in the experiments of this thesis, both the number of genes and the average size of the genes increased. One possible explanation for this is that, in their work, their increased mutation rate $\mu_+$ was set to $1e^{-3}$.  By contrast, even the elevated mutation rate used here, $\mu_+$, was just $4e^{-7}$, which is $\frac{1}{4}*e^4 \approx 13.65$ times lower than their highest mutation rate. Perhaps an even higher mutation rate would be sufficient to overcome the power of selection and reduce the genome further. 

\subsection{Robustness \& Evolvability}
The robustness results indicate that the stable environment is not requiring much differentiation between the different conditions.  The average difference in robustness between any of the conditions and the control condition was only 0.002803, i.e. only 0.28\%. Robustness does not seem to be selected for in any of the conditions. 


%TODO Perform another experiment with a much higher mutation rate: 1e-3 for 100k generations?
