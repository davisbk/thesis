\chapter{Results and Discussion}\label{ch:results_discussion}
This chapter presents the results of our experiments as performed according to the description in Chapter~\ref{ch:methods}. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the results and their relation to real-world organisms, as well as potential limitations of our results.

\section{Results}\label{results}
In this section we present the results of our experiments. We begin by presenting the results of our statistical analysis before moving on to show the results in various plots. It is of minor note that in many of the figures, a rolling window was used to smooth the values, resulting in many of the plots only showing data starting after a few thousand generations (often 10,000). It should be noted, however, that organisms were evolved for 500,000 generations and that the data is complete. 

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
Below in Table~ we see the results of our p-value calculations for testing whether the results are significant.   

\subsection{Genome Size}
In this section we will examine the results of the different conditions, focusing on which, if any, lead to a reduced genome. Figure~\ref{fig:genome_size}
presents the main findings regarding genome size. In the figure, the blue line represents the control condition and the other colors show the changed conditions: mutation up/down, selection up/down, and population up/down. As can be seen from the figure,the results did not actually vary all that much across the conditions with regard to genome size.  
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{stat_fitness_global_mean_genome_size}
	\centering
	\caption[Genome size]{Genome size in number of bases of all conditions. Average taken across all five seeds for each condition.}
	\label{fig:genome_size}
\end{figure}
In fact the \textit{population down} condition had a runaway increase in the number of bases, reaching over 16,500 bases, at least a 25\% increase over the original wild type's roughly 13,200. Surprisingly, even after 500,000 generations it seems that the upper limit may still not have been reached. 

The next obvious observation is that of the remaining conditions, only the \textit{selection up} condition seems to have made much of a significant change with its 11\% increase. All of the remaining conditions had a mild increase in genome size. 

Also noteworthy is that the mutation down condition appears to have had a steady increase in the number of base pairs until a maximum of just over 14,000 around generation 350,000 before having a fairly sharp decline back to nearly the original size. 

\subsection{Metabolic Error}

	\label{fig:mean_metabolic_error}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Genome Structure}
In this section we examine the effects of the differing conditions on the structure of the genome as measured by the criteria in Tables~\ref{table:aevol_stats_genes_and_bp} and~\ref{table:aevol_stats_fitness_and_mutation}. 
\subsubsection{Non-coding DNA}
One important factor in genome structure is the amount of non-coding DNA, i.e. the number of bases which are part of a genome but which do not encode protein sequences. In the case of aevol, this means 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{stat_bp_mean_num_bp_not_in_any_CDS}
	\caption[Non-coding DNA]{Plot of non-coding DNA over time for all conditions, average of all seeds.}
	\label{fig:mean_non-coding_DNA}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Number of Genes}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{stat_genes_global_mean_num_functional_genes}
	\caption[Mean number of functional genes]{Plot showing the mean number of functional genes over time across all seeds.}
	\label{fig:mean_num_functional_genes}
\end{figure}
Interesting that so many of the lines are so flat and the mutation up line is so wiggly. Clearly the increased mutation rate was creating and destroying genes, whereas in the other cases it was a pretty even rate. 
\subsubsection{Average Size of Functional Genes}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{stat_genes_global_mean_avg_size_of_functional_genes}
	\caption[Average size of functional genes]{Plot showing the average size of functional genes over time for all seeds.}
	\label{fig:mean_functional_gene_size}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Evolvability}
In Figure~\ref{fig:evolvability_mean} below, we see the results of the experiments on evolvability for the best individual's (at generation 500,000) lineage. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{evolvability_boxplot_all_seeds_avg}
	\caption[Evolvability boxplot]{A box plot showing the mean evolvability spread of all seeds and all conditions. Higher numbers are more evolvable.}
	\label{fig:evolvability_mean}	
\end{figure}
The figure illustrates that, overall, for each condition the best individual still had close to zero evolvability. For the selection up condition, however, the deviation from zero was even smaller. Table~\ref{table:mean_std_dev_evolvability} below provides the mean and standard deviation for the evolvability. 

\begin{table}

	\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
		\hline
		 & $\sigma$ & std dev \\

	\label{table:mean_std_dev_evolvability}
\end{table}
\subsection{Robustness}
Recall that robustness is measured by the fraction of neutral mutants of an individual. In the following figure, we see a bar plot showing the spread of neutral mutants for the best individual for the control condition as well as the six variations.

\subsection{Limitations of Results}\label{limitations}
One limitation to consider is that only one parameter varied per condition. It may be possible that it is only under a combination of conditions (e.g. low selection \textit{and} high mutation rates) does reductive evolution occur. 

Another limitation is that the environments did not vary in our experiments. This could potentially have a large effect on robustness and evolvability, which are strong influencers of reductive evolution. 

Aevol as a modeling software is limited in that it relies, like all models, on several simplifications. The population sizes tested here, even in the population up condition, are still much smaller than would be found in real world populations.
