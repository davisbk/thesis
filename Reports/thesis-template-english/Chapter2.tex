\section{In Silico Evolution}
In addition to the difficulties discussed in Section \ref{problem_statement}, in vivo experiments, although sometimes more realistic, have their own set of difficulties, including challenging environmental conditions (e.g. simulating the open ocean in a lab) and simulating the multiple selection pressures acting on genomes in the real world \cite{Batut.2013}, sometimes making it difficult or impossible to tell which factor(s) lead to which outcome. 

In silico evolution simulates organisms in software, thus allowing for far greater control and analysis of the environment and other experimental conditions. Varying strategies can be used to create the organisms (e.g. random genes, explicitly providing a previously-evolved genome, etc.) and then the organisms may interact, reproduce, and evolve, with the fittest individuals surviving to produce the next generation. 

Factors such as the mutation rates or selection pressure are then parameters for the model and may be kept constant or allowed to vary over time. Given that these are parameters of the system, they may be tightly controlled, leading to a clearer picture of the factors influencing different outcomes. An underlying deterministic model can also allow for a reconstruction of the system from any given point, allowing one to easily create a record of events, including phylogenetic trees. 

\subsubsection{Why use aevol}
%TODO - Add comparison with AEGIS\cite{Bradshaw646877}, etc. AEGIS is used to study aging. Relevant?

%TODO Add some examples of research aspects studied by using Aevol
In the following sections, each of the three steps of aevol will be examined in greater detail.

\section{aevol}
The in silico tool \textit{aevol} was developed to "study the evolution of the size and organization of bacterial genomes in various scenarios"\cite{Batut.2013}. Organisms are simulated with a binary genome which can either be generated at random or input as a previously-generated sequence. aevol essentially consists of three steps: 1) decoding the genome of these organisms to produce artificial proteins, 2) selecting the most fit individuals and 3) reproduction of these fittest individuals with possible variations (mutations, rearrangements, etc.). The population size $N$ is kept constant and a record of each generation is kept so that the phylogenetic lineages can be recreated.

\subsection{Aevol's Architecture}
Aevol essentially consists of three steps: decoding the genome, selection, and reproduction. These steps are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:aevol_overview01} and described in more detail below.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Decoding the Genome}
In aevol a genome consists of a string of binary characters where 0 is complementary to 1. Each organism in the clonal population has a double-stranded circular genome which is either generated randomly or which was provided as input. To decode the genome and produce the phenotype, the sequence is searched for transcribed regions. Transcribed regions are denoted by promoter and terminator sequences. The promoter sequence is a sequence whose Hamming distance $d$ is within $d_{max} = 4$ mismatches of the predefined consensus sequence $0101011001110010010110$. Terminators are sequences which can form a stem-loop structure with a stem size of 4 bases and a loop length of 3 bases. Lastly, the initiation and termination signals are sought, which are simply Shine-Dalgarno-like signals (i.e. $011011****000$ to start and $011011****001$ to stop). 

Once an initiation sequence is found, the following bases are read three at a time according to the genetic code given in Figure \ref{fig:aevol_overview01} until a stop codon (by default $001$) is found. These codons encode for three parameters, $M$ (mean), $W$ (half-width), and $H$ (height), which together define a triangle representing a "cellular process".

A cellular process is simply an abstract representation of some phenotypic function and is represented by the ordered set $\Omega = \left[0,1\right] \subset \mathbb{R}$. \textit{Fuzzy logic} is used to find the overall contribution of each cellular process. The mean $M$, then, gives us the specific cellular process, and is in the range $\left[0,1\right]$ The width describes the "scope" of the process, i.e. the \textit{pleiotropy} of the process. Lastly, the height determines the degree of possibility of the process, i.e. its relative strength. Since a transcribed region may have multiple initiation signals, codons are allowed.  

\subsubsection{Selection}
After the genome is decoded, the organisms are tested for their fitness. Fitness in Aevol is defined as the gap between the phenotype of a sequence and the environmental function $f_E$, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:aevol_overview01}. This environmental target function $f_E$ is a user-determined set of Gaussians which are specified in a parameter file. The difference between the phenotype (as calculated above) and the environmental function is the "metabolic error", labeled $g$ in the Figure. 

Aevol contains several selection schemes but here we will only consider the \texttt{fitness\_proportionate} scheme, since this was the only selection scheme employed in our experiments. In this scheme, the probability of reproduction for each organism is proportionate to its fitness, which is to say $exp(-k * g)$, where $k$ is a user-definable parameter which determines the selection intensity and $g$ is the metabolic error.
\subsubsection{Reproduction}
